% As a sample LaTeX document, this is an actual assignment 
% written in LaTeX with my template for MATH 417, 
% Honors Real Variables (Measure Theory) at University of Alberta.
% This source has been released with permission with the instructor,
% Professor John C. Bowman as the solutions are available at
% https://www.math.ualberta.ca/~bowman/m417/assign1.pdf

% Of course, don't plagiarize! Just because you have the solutions
% to whatever problems there is does not mean you should copy it.
% The only way to learn math is to do the problems yourself!

% Moreover, I do not warrant any correctness of these solutions.
% These are simply what I have written which may contain mistakes.

% UPDATE (2/1/19): Unfortunately, by the request of my professor
% John C. Bowman with potential plagiarism in future years,
% I removed all the solutions and replaced them with [Redacted].
% However, all the problem texts are kept.

Let $(S_n)_1^\infty$ sequences of sets.
Define
\[
    \liminf_{n\to\infty} S_n\defeq \bigcup_{k=1}^\infty \bigcap_{n=k}^\infty S_n, \quad \limsup_{n\to\infty} S_n\defeq \bigcap_{k=1}^\infty \bigcup_{n=k}^\infty S_n.
\]
Show that
\[
    \liminf_{n\to\infty} S_n\subset \limsup_{n\to\infty} S_n.

Let $(S_j)_1^\infty$ sequence of sets.
Define $T_1=S_1$ and
\[
    T_j\defeq S_j \setminus \bigcup_{i=1}^{j-1}S_i, \quad j\in 2,3, \ldots.
\]
Prove that $(T_j)_1^\infty$ is a sequence of pairwise disjoint sets satisfying
\[
    \bigcup_{j=1}^n T_j=\bigcup_{j=1}^n S_j, \quad \text{all }n\in\naturals

Determine whether each of the following sets are countable.
Justify your answers.

\subsection{Part (a)}
The set of all mappings from $1\ldots,N$ to $\naturals$ where $N\in\naturals$ is fixed.
