What is the wrong in the following argument that \textit{The set $(0,1)$ is countable}?
Express the open set $(0,1)$ as a union of open intervals $I_x$ centered on each real $x\in (0,1)$:
\[
    \bigcup_{x\in (0,1)} I_x=(0,1).
\]
Each interval $I_x$ contains a rational which we can use as a label for that interval.
Since there are only countably many rational numbers, there are countably many labels.
Hence the above union actually contains only a countable number of intervals, each centered at a real number.
There are therefore only a countable number of real numbers.

Let $S\subset \real^d$ such that
\[
    m^*(E\cap S) + m^*(E\cap S^c) = m(E).

\begin{solution}
    Solution removed.
\end{solution}

\subsection{Part (b)}
\textit{Dominated Convergence}.
Suppose that $S_n$ are all contained inside another Lebesgue measurable set $F$ of finite measure.
Show that $m(S_n)\to m(S)$ as $n\to \infty$.

\begin{solution}
    Solution removed.
\end{solution}

\subsection{Part (c)}

Give a counterexample to show that the dominated convergence theorem fails if the $S_n$ are not contained in a set of finite measure, even if we assume that $m(S_n)$ are all uniformly bounded.

\begin{solution}
    Solution removed.

Let $d,d'\in \naturals$.

\subsection{Part (a)}

If $A\subset \real^d$ and $B\subset \real^d$, show that
\[
    m^{d+d'*}(A\times B)\le m^{d*}(A)m^{d'*}(B).

    Solution removed.

\subsection{Part (b)}
Let $A\subset \real^d$ and $B\subset \real^{d'}$ Lebesgue measurable sets (not necessarily of finite measure).
Show that $A\times B$ is Lebesgue Measurable with
\[
    m(A\times B)=m(A)m(B).
